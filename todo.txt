Position in model. Do not store position in model. Get it from
chess.js when necessary. Store FEN string in game flow, it contains
more info. Also store last move in game flow to visualize last move.

Ideas:

Find and load chess PGN. Explanations for many chess position. Display
then while playing. Chess.js supports it.

Two modes: play, setup.  In setup mode players can remove, add, move
pieces freely. When mode switches to play, a branch should be created
in the game flow graph in case there is a difference.

Game flow graph can be clickable. When clicked, game continues from
there on a new branch. Old branchs stay.

Hovering on game flow graph will temporarily display that
position.

Multiple game flow selections. Creation of multiple games.

Move games to local drive from cookies.

Display the captured piece if one was captured during last move.

Display all captured piece.

Display squre coordinates.

Display who's turn is it.
